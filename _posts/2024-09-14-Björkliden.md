We decided to hike up to the top of Låktatjåkka, to work up an appetite before breakfast, and were met by stunning views to the north, and towards Norway. 
Looking east, the lake of Torne träsk looked huge, and looking east there were a lot of rain pouring down over Norway. The wind was 
brisk, and after enjoying the views for maybe ten minutes, we hiked back down and ate a wonderful breakfast buffet.

After that we rounded up our belongings and started hiking down the mountain towards Björkliden, and the train home. The views of Torne träsk were stunning the whole way, 
and we saw a flock of maybe 40 Snow Buntings flying around. Getting closer to Björkliden, we started to follow the Rákkasjohka, a stream 
that had white rocks surrounding it. It must have been limestone residue or something, because the rocks were only white next to the stream. 
There were a series of waterfalls going down to Torne träsk, of which the last one is quite famous, and called Silverfallet. We never made it the whole way down to 
the lake, but went to the train station and boarded our train home. All in all, one of my best trips north.
