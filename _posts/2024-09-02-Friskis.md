### Start lifting weights

Today, I went to the local gym and asked for a "try-out-week". We have a chain of gyms in Stockholm called "Friskis och Svettis" which sort of translates to "Healthy and Sweaty". They allow you to try out the gym for free for a week, but I'm pretty certain I will start going there after my tryout period.
Being there at 10 am meant the gym was quite empty, and only older people who don't have a job to go to were there. I have decided to try doing some big compound exercises to see what happens after a couple of weeks.

This first visit was more of a test run, to find where I'm at. I did the following.

- Deadlift 5x8 40kg
- Pullup 5 5 5 4 2
- Hacksquat 5x8 50kg (plus sled)
- Bench press 5x8 30kg

I also did ten reps of free handstand, I'm a bit rusty, and some leg raises, and tested my max handstand against the wall (1 minute exactly)

It was fun and not too tiring, next time I'm going to add 10 kg each to hacksquat, bench press and deadlift. 
Hopefully I will be able to do 5x5 pullups soon, seems like I lost a lot of strength in those.
