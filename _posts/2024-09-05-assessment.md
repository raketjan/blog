### Pre-training Assessments

I listened to the six episode Andrew Huberman and Andy Galpin podcast where Andy goes througn everything related to resistance and endurance training, recovery and supplements, and decided to go all in on a structured training program. 
Andy talks about 9 exercise-induced adaptions, namely

- Skill/Technique (move better, more efficiently)
- Speed (higher velocity, better rate of acceleration)
- Power (speed multiplied by force)
- Force/Strength (1 rep max)
- Muscle Hypertrophy (how big is you muscle)
- Muscular Endurance (how many repetitions in a row, localized)
- Anaerobic Capacity (maximum heartrate, total physiological limitation, up to 120 sek)
- Maximal Aerobic Capacity (8-15 minutes range, both max heartrateand true Vo2Max)
- Long Duration (steady state, cardio. Ability to keep moving, more than 20 minutes)

All of these have some assessments that I intend to do, and in a couple of months, or a year, I will do them again to see if I have improved.

[Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-assess-improve-all-aspects-of-your-fitness)


## Skill
Gold standard is having a physical therapist, movement specialist go through all my ways of moving. I do have my naprapath Thobias who will definitely be able to assess my limitations and see if I can improve. Besides that
I will definitely define some skills I intend to improve, namely handstands and gymnastic stuff.
Andy suggests the following to assess.
Go joint by joint 3 to 10 reps per exercise

Upper body press (Push up)
Upper body pull (Pull up)
Lower body press (Squat)
Lower body pull (Deadlift)

Look for:
* Symmetry
* Stability
* Awareness
* All ranges of motion

## Speed
You really don't have to assess these, but if you want to run a hundred meters etc.

## Power
Broad jump, measure how far you can jump from standing. Try to jump your height.
Vertical jump, measure how far you can reach on a wall with your fingertips. put something on your fingertips and jump as high as you can. If youre older than 50 years old 20 inches is fine (51cm).

## Strength
Grip strength - buy a hand grip dynometer, minimum 40kg, ideally 60kg and no more than 10% difference between hands.
Dead hang - hang from pullup bar as long as possible, minimum 30 seconds, above 60 seconds is good.
Leg extension - One rep, above body weight is ideal up to 40 years old, and reduce by 10% per decade after.
Front squat hold - hold a weight in front of you and hold the bottom position for 45 seconds.
All of these assume perfect form, don't do anything with poor form.

Also think of a standard warm-up protocol prior to these one rep max tests.
[Warm-up protocol](https://www.nsca.com/search/?searchQuery=warm-up)

## Hypertrophy
Do a Dexa scan.
FFMI (fat-free mass index), aim for 20+.

## Muscular endurance
Plank - 60 seconds+
Side-plank - 30 seconds+
Push-up - 25+ consecutive

Adding some of my own gymnastics-related ones here.
Handstand - 60 seconds+
L-sit - 30 seconds+

## Anaerobic capacity, Heart Rate
Sprinting, AirBike go as hard as possibly can for 30-60 seconds and mark down how far you go.
Or the Bosco protocol. Jump as high as you can for 60 seconds, try to hit predicted maximum heart rate.
Heart rate recovery. From max heartrate, you should have a recovery of 30 beats per minute. 


## Maximal Hart Rate (VO2max)
Best is to get an actual Vo2max test in a lab

12 min Cooper test, run as hard as you can and determine what distance you covered 
check [Cooper test calculator](https://exrx.net/Calculators/MinuteRun) what that corresponds to.
Men 35 ml/kg, wanna see men above 50 ml/kg (2.75km), 55ml/kg is optimal (60 is wow)

## Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test (Endurance)
You should maintain consistant output for 20 min, with nasal breathing only moving at a non moving pace, zone 2-3-4â€¦ 
I will do 1 hour of nose-breathing running, and check how far i can go.
