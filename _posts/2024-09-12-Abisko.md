### Abisko in fall  

So, Lisa, my girlfriend, didn't get to hike at all this summer, and really wanted to see some Swedish "fj√§ll", 
mountains. We boarded the nighttrain to Abisko way up north in Sweden on wednesday evening, and arrived in 
Abisko around lunch today. When we arrived, the sky's cleared up, and a massive rainbow met us at the "Lapporten". After a lunch
 at the mountain station, we started hiking through Abisko National Park, towards the hut at Abiskojaure. 
There we stayed the night, and had a wonderful sauna with a bunch of mainly german hikers, swimming in the lake.
