### Abisko in fall  

So, Lisa, my girlfriend, didn't get to hike at all this summer, and really wanted to see some Swedish "fjäll", 
mountains. We boarded the nighttrain to Abisko way up north in Sweden on wednesday evening, and arrived in 
Abisko around lunch today. When we arrived, the sky's cleared up, and a massive rainbow met us at the "Lapporten". After a lunch
 at the mountain station, we started hiking through Abisko National Park, towards the hut at Abiskojaure. 
There we stayed the night, and had a wonderful sauna with a bunch of mainly german hikers, swimming in the lake.
