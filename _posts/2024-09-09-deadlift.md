### Back hurting from deadlifts

I have started my new training routine, and the resistance training involves doing the following excersises:
- Pullups
- Leg press (in my case machine hacksquat)
- Bench press
- Deadlift

Turns out I'm doing something wrong with my deadlifts because I got my classic "ryggskott" back, pain in the lower back.

Not sure what to do about this, but i think I will do many and not too heavy back raises until the back is completely revcovered, and 
then do many light repetitions with hopefully perfect form. I will ask someone to spot me, and point out any mistakes.
