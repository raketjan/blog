### Abiskojaure - Låktatjåkka

After eating some breakfast in the cabin friday morning, we started hiking towards Kårsavagge. First up some 600 meters, and then down 400 meters, passing 
between Boazočohkka (1272m) and peak of the ridge of Njunesgeačhi (1150m), with stunning views south, but also looking down inte the valley of Gorsavággi and the mountains further north. 
Coming down inteo the valley, with the ground covered in all shades of yellow, brown and red, we forded the jokk at the Kårsavagge hut and had lunch next to the cabins. 
We then went up a steep ravine to get to the lake of Latnajávri, where there is a couple of small houses where scientists study the effects of the increase in CO2 gases in the atmosphere. 
Continuing north, the environment became more and more barren, with mostly rocks to walk on. We soon got to the Låktatjåkka mountain hur where we were going to stay the night.

After a brief sauna we were served amazing arctic char, followed by applething with fennel icecream. We and a man from sothern Sweden were the only guests, apart from a bunch of 
seasonal workers who joined for dinner. WE had a great evening with some great wines, but retreated early to bed.
