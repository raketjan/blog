Today, I activated my 30 day GitHub CoPilot trial, it's time to enter the future. The plan is to get up to speed with this 
before I start my new job assignment on monday. Not completely sure how they feel about AI helping out, but I feel I need 
to at least try these tools out. So far so good, doing some Microsoft Learn tutorials and GitHub Codespace stuff.
