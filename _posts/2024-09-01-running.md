### My new running form

After almost five months of hiking, my body has lost a lot of fat, and my mitochondria should be firing on all cylinders, so yesterday I went for a one hour run. I decided to keep it somewhat slow and only run so fast that i could breathe through the nose. I ran down to Trekanten by Liljeholmen, and then ran next to the water until I headed back home again. I felt great, but also noted that just a slight incline upwards meant that I needed a lot more of oxygen.

Here's some data from my apple watch, pretty cool.
